## Description

A task-management application created with Django framework, allowing users to create their own, individual task lists. Handles create, read, update and delete functionalities (CRUD), registering new users and some basic tasks sorting. 

## Goals

This project was intended as an practice and repetition of Django-related technologies and activities such as:

- creating CRUD functionality,
- writing Class based views,
- working with HTML and CSS,
- hidding sensitive project informations (secret key, database credentials),
- writing efficient and clear Django code

## TODOs

Some ideas and tasks to realize in the future:

- [ ] write unit tests,
- [ ] implement drag-and-drop tasks rearrangement functionality,
- [ ] try to deploy the application (for example, on Heroku)
